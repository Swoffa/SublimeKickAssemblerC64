New in version 1.2.3:
- New setting kickass_output_path for setting output-folder, default is bin
- New setting kickass_compiled_filename for setting filename of compiled prg-file
  Default is SourceFile.prg, which is a change, before it was SourceFile_Compiled.prg
  Thanks wizofwor for suggestion
- Menu items for accessing settings and preferences
  Can be found in menu  Preferences -> Package Settings -> SublimeKickAssemblerC64
  Thanks to @brushesm (https://github.com/brushesm) for this.
- New Feature: Setting for default prebuild-/postbuild-path
  Settings default_prebuild_path and default_postbuild_path for setting default prebuild-/postbuild path
  Prebuild/postbuild-scripts located in the current directory will take precedence, 
  but if not found the default path is also checked. No default value.
