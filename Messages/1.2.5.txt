New in version 1.2.5:
- Bug fix: Preferences and settings menus now  works when package is installed thru Package Control.
  Thanks Pontus Berg (https://github.com/BacchusFLT) for reporting this
- New Feature: Make command, assigned to key F8. Invokes a script called make.bat/make.sh.
  Use setting default_make_path for setting default make path,
  make-scripts located in the current directory will take precedence, 
  but if not found the default path is also checked. No default value.
