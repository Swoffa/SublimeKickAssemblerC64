New in version 1.0.2:
- The Java CLASSPATH is used when running Kick Assembler, 
  which means you can place the KickAss.jar file anywhere, 
  as long as it exists in your CLASSPATH environment variable
- Small fixes in language-definition (syntax coloring)
- Version upped to 1.0, to indicate that all basic functionality is in there and that its fairly stable
