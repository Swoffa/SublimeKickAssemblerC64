New in version 1.3.1:
- New feature: Segment support, file annotaion to configure which file to start
  Put startup-file annotation on first line of startup file (replace filename.prg): 
  // @kickass-build "file-to-run": "filename.prg"
  With Vice you can start files on D64-disks with syntax "diskFilename.d64:prgname" (lower case without prg-extension)
