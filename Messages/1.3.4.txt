Changes in version 1.3.4:
- Fix: Using full paths for Vice (x64) commands, 
  Since version 3.5 for macOS does not handle relative paths well.
  Issue #64 reported by John Cook (https://github.com/jcook793)
- New feature: startup-file build annotion
  Put startup-file annotation on first line of a file to configure which file to compile for "startup commands".
  Has precedence over setting kickass_startup_file_path.
  // @kickass-build "startup-file": "filename.asm"
  Issue #57 reported by Pontus Berg (https://github.com/BacchusFLT)
